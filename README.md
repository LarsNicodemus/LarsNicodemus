# üí´ About Me

üëã Hi, I'm Lars!  
üì± **App Developer** | Kotlin & Swift | Former Sales Expert turned passionate software engineer

After 16 years in sales ‚Äì with leadership, goal orientation, and empathy ‚Äì I‚Äôve pivoted to build meaningful mobile and web applications. Not vanity projects, but software that‚Äôs truly needed.

üß† I think like a developer. And I act like someone who wants to solve real problems.

üå± **Currently Learning**  
React Native, Flutter, JavaScript, performance optimization, React, Next.js, Ionic & Capacitor ‚Äì driven by real-world use and continuous curiosity.

- **Eventually**: Android app for planning meaningful milestones ‚Äì from anniversaries to life goals.  
- **Primeal Dungeon**: A Kotlin roguelike game ‚Äì because code can (and should) be fun, too.

üí° **Open to Collaborations on**

üìö I‚Äôm currently expanding my cross-platform and web skills at velpTEC ‚Äì focusing on practical use cases and continuous learning. For me, learning is a daily habit. So is contributing to projects that matter.

üéØ I‚Äôm not looking for a to-do list. I‚Äôm looking for responsibility.  
Whether it‚Äôs mobile, frontend, or cross-functional projects ‚Äì I‚Äôm open to teams that think boldly, communicate clearly, and see software as more than just code. I bring tech skills, communication experience, and an entrepreneurial mindset.
